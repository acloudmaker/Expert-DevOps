Expert Series Continued...DevOps, learning through the popular tools, platforms and frameworks, to get the best of the best technololgies around, and most importantly learning from the best of the minds who have implemented and made vast progress through their hands-on experiences to substitute complex with simple.

## Organzation Maturity Journey
1. **Current Stat**e: Determine and document to begin with where the Organization Operational Maturity (**OOM**) falls within the 4 levels of Operationa Maturity (Manual, Semi-Automated, IaC, CIaC) based on current configuration and provisioning practices across different teams, environments, products, platform and infrastrucure portfolios. Also document the alignment and gaps from the current goverance, security and audit standpoint. While documenting keep in mind, very clearly, the end goals and the means of accomplishing the end goals. The objective is to achieve efficiency (operational and cost) and 100% control on risk.
2. **Future State**: Determine and document in an absolute sense where the organization wants to be, without being biased by factors including investments from a timing, cost and resource investments as well as what's possible and not possible. Those factors will play a role while designing and building the bridge to connect the current state with the future state but they do not influence the future state.
3. **The Bridge to Future**: Now it is time get to work by defining the HOWs. Depending on the current state, current timeline-money-resource investment appetite and budget, prioritization objectives, training needs etc., define the journey path for each participant to cross the bridge, one block at a time, with various checkpoint stops along the way.  
_Interesting Discovery_: After using my bridge metaphor to bridge the current state to future state, I came across [this article](https://preferredreturn.com/blog/for-hashicorp-co-founder-armon-dadgar-age-is-a-double-edged-sword/). Curious to find out if HashiCorp is a publicly traded company, I googled it and found this on the top of the SRP:
